# My dotfiles

This repo exists to hold my dotfiles so I can sync my configs across Arch Linux
systems (ideally, but these dotfiles might work with other GNU/Linux distros)

Just clone the repo to `.dotfiles` and run `git checkout`.

``` shell
gh-get that1m8head dotfiles .dotfiles
git checkout
```

I'll outline the prerequisites some other time. :p
