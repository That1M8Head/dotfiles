#+Title: My dotfiles
#+Author: Arsalan Kazmi

This repo contains my dotfiles... from a semi-broken laptop. Yeah, I'll have it overhauled when I can get an actually good computer to run Arch on.

#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    char* msg = "Here's some random C!";
    printf("%s\n", msg);
    return 0;
}
#+end_src
